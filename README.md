## What does it do?
Adding this script into your browser will allow you to import/export your character from/into simple JSON code for whatever reason there is. 
So you can:
* Share your character with your friend.
* Back up your character.
* Save some characters into files to add new ones, if you surpassed character limit.

It's advised to click **Save** button before importing, still!

:sparkles: This addon is made 100% without game code modification. :sparkles:

## How do I install?
1. Install Tampermonkey userscript extension for your browser. No guarantees of working with other extensions
* [Tampermonkey for Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Safari / Firefox / Opera Next / Dolphin Browser / UC Browser](http://tampermonkey.net/)
2. Add userscript by clicking here: [[Install userscript]](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/Neeve/PonyTown_ImportExport)
3. If you already had any opened PonyTown tabs, don't forget to refresh

# How do I use?
Switch to your character's **Body** tab, press **Import** button and paste character code. For example, `{}` will clear all your current character settings.
Likewise, click **Export** if you want to export.

## Troubleshooting
* Nothing happens, or exporting window immediately closes after clicking on **Export**.
   * Press **Ctrl + Shift + I**, check your **Console** for errors.
* Character won't import!
   * Likewise, press **Ctrl + Shift + I**, check your **Console** for errors.
* There's no Import/Export buttons.
   * If PonyTown was updated recently, just wait for me to update userscript.
   * No? Probably a browser issue. Try updating it, and if it won't work anyway, send me details about your browser.
