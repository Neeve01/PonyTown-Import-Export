# Tested with PonyTown 0.28.4-alpha version!

## Living on the edge?
This branch is marked "experimental" for a reason. There's no guarantee that features in this branch might end up being in final version. However, it's a good place to test things out.

It doesn't mean this branch can inflict any damage.

## How do I install?
1. Install Tampermonkey userscript extension for your browser. However, you may install any other, but I recommend this one.
* [Tampermonkey for Chrome / Microsoft Edge / Safari / Firefox / Opera Next / Dolphin Browser / UC Browser](http://tampermonkey.net/)
2. Add userscript by clicking here: [[Install userscript]](https://github.com/Neeve01/PonyTown-Import-Export/raw/experimental/PonyTown_IE.user.js).
3. If you already had opened PonyTown tabs, don't forget to refresh!

## Troubleshooting
* Nothing happens, or exporting window immediately closes after clicking on **Export**.
  * Press **Ctrl + Shift + I**, check your **Console** for errors.
* Character won't import!
  * Likewise, press **Ctrl + Shift + I**, check your **Console** for errors.
* There's no Import/Export buttons.
  * If PonyTown was updated recently, just wait for me to update userscript.
  * No? Probably a browser issue. Try updating it, and if it won't work anyway, send me details about your browser.
